The registration page ensures the user puts an email in the email field, and that the password is atleast 6 characters long. 
The email is then checked to ensure there isnt a pre-existing email in the database. 
The password further is hashed by using the Hash key that is stored in an environment variable that is not uploaded on GIT-HUB.
It is also required to have all the fields filled out before pressing submit or an error will occur.
After registrating, there will be a confirmation message and the page will be redirected the use to the login page.

The login page is a component in React creates a call to the backend, (NodeJS) to ensure the email is exists.
Once that is confirmed it unhashes the password from the database and checks if it is the same as the one entered.
If it is not then it will indicate that the password is not correct or the email does not exist accordingly. 
- It also creates a JWT Token to esnure the use is logged in unless they click log out
- The token is stored on the local storage and when the log out button is pressed the storage is cleared

Once logged in, it gives a message that the user is logged in. It further directs the user to the Shop page and 
changes the Nav Bar to have options that only display when a user is logged in. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
